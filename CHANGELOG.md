## [2.0.0] - 2019-12-03
## Breaking changes

### Updates
- Update the PHP and WordPress versions in Travis.

- Bump PHP Unit and WP PHP Unit.
- Remove PHPMD in composer scripts and bin/.
- Adding new Option class for settings integrations.

### Changes
- All tasks need to be their `clearScheduledEvent` method to be updated, 
see [ExampleMigrationTask.php](src/Tasks/ExampleMigrationTask.php), as a second param is now required to pass in
the `UpgradeModel`, which is injected into the `dispatch` method.

## [1.3.0] - 2019-11-25
- Make sure WordPress' option for `timezone_string` returns a string, update to use helper method which will call
WordPress's new `wp_timezone_string` if available (WordPress >= 5.3) otherwise uses it's code. Fixes #9.

## [1.2.0] - 2019-03-07

### Fixed
- getOption not loading. Moved from `UpgradesListTable` to `Upgrade` and renamed to getOptions.

## [1.1.2] - 2019-03-07
### Fixed
- Moved `getNonceKeyValue` method from `UpgradesListTable` to `Upgrade` since UpgradesListTable is no longer loaded outside

a 500 server error.
